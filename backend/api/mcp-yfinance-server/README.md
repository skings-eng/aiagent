This project sets up a **stock Price server** powered by the **Yahoo Finance (YFinance)** API and built for seamless integration with **MCP (Multi-Agent Control Protocol)**.

It allows AI agents or clients to:
- Retrieve real-time stock data
- Manage a watchlist
- Perform full stock analysis
- Run full technical indicators
- And much more

## 🪙 Start Simple: Build a Crypto Price Tracker First
Before diving into the full-blown stock server, I recommend starting with this simple crypto tracker built with Python + MCP 👇

🔗 GitHub Repo:
https://github.com/Adity-star/mcp-crypto-server

> You'll learn how to:
> - Use MCP to expose crypto tools like get_price("BTC")
> - Build an API with FastAPI
> - Fetch real-time prices using the Alpaca API

---
## 📈 Then Level Up: Build the yFinance Stock Server
Once you're familiar with the flow, move on to this more advanced stock tracker 💹

## 📦 Step 1: Set Up the Environment (with uv)

We use **[uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)** — a modern, ultra-fast Python package manager — to manage our project environment.

### 🛠️ Installation & Setup

Run the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Install uv
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh 

# Create and navigate to your project directory
mkdir mcp-yfinance-server
cd mcp-yfinance-server

# Initialize a new project
uv init

# Create and activate the virtual environment
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

```
## 📥 Install the project
Once your [pyproject.toml](https://github.com/Adity-star/mcp-yfinance-server/blob/main/pyproject.toml) is set up with dependencies, run: 
```bash
#  Run 
uv pip install -e .

```

---
## 🚀 Step 2: Running the MCP Server
Once your environment is ready, start the stock server:
```bash
cp ../yf_serve.py .
uv run source/yf_server.py
```
🧪 Want a quick test first?
Try running the lightweight demo server:
```bash
uv run demo_stock_price_server.py
```

📄 Curious how the full server works?

## ⚙️ Step 4: Configure Your MCP Server

To integrate your YFinance MCP server, add the following entry to your mcp.config.json file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "yfinance-price-tracker": {
      "command": "/ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/uv",
      "args": [
        "--directory",
        "/ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/YOUR/mcp-yfinance-server",
        "run",
        "yf_server.py"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
> ⚠️ Replace /ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/... with actual file paths.
> 💡 Tip: Rename your server from crypto-price-tracker to yfinance-price-tracker for clarity.

---
## 🔁 Step 5: Restart Claude Desktop

Restart **Claude Desktop** (or any interface that uses MCP) to reload and activate your new YFinance tools.
> This ensures the updated MCP configuration is recognized and all stock tracking tools are 
 ready to use.

---
## ✅ Step 6: Testing the MCP Server with Claude Desktop

- With everything installed and configured, you're ready to test your MCP server in **Claude Desktop**.

Use these example queries to test your MCP YFinance Server in action:

> "Compare the stock prices of Tesla and Apple."
> → 🔧 Uses `compare_stocks`

> "Get the historical data for Tesla over the past month."
> → 📊 Uses `get_stock_history`

> "Add Apple, Tesla, and Reliance to my watchlist."
> → 📋 Uses `add_to_watchlist`

> "Show me a chart of Apple’s stock over the last 30 days."
> → 🖼️ Claude can fetch + visualize data using your server
